I have an account in your database with the name …………… and the email address that is linked to the account is ……………….
Meanwhile, for some reason, I have decided not to use the account again, therefore I request that you kindly delete my account from your database and also wipe all notifications if any.

NOTE: The name, email address and phone number that will be contained in the mail must be linked to the account you want to delete. This will be proof that you are the real owner of the account.

<b>SUBJECT: Request To Delete My Account From Your Database</b>

To Whom It May Concern: I would like to hereby formally request the removal of all my personal and private details from your company database as soon as possible. I have recently noticed an increased amount of junk mail as well as telephone calls from companies that I have never been in touch with in the past which are very disruptive and intrusive.

However, in order to avoid this from continuing, I prefer have my details removed completely from your database as perhaps (name of company) has passed my details to a third party marketing company recently. Please confirm to me in writing that this has been done. I thank you in advance, Kind regards (Your name)

Meanwhile, if your mobile number is not linked to the account, there will be no need for you to add any phone number.
